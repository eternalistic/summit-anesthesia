    <div class="column-first column">
      <p>My name is Josh Braman. I was raised in central Minnesota on a farm. My wife, Molly, is a Spokane native. We recently moved to Spokane Valley from Rockford, WA.  We have two daughters who keep us busy. We enjoy camping, canoeing and road-tripping as a family.</p>
      <p>I am an old-fashioned soul; a handshake and someoneâ€™s word mean something to me still.</p>
      <p>We employ several honest, hardworking, clean-cut men who are family-oriented.</p>
